Abstract 

In video surveillance scenarios, face recognition accuracy is often affected by low-resolution and occlusion in captured face images. However, existing face image recovery models typically only handle one type of variation. To address this limitation, we propose a two-step approach that utilizes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for face completion and a Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) for enhancing image resolution. The generator model aims to generate ahigh-resolution face image without occlusion by taking a low-resolution face image with occlusion as input.

Due to the increasing number of thefts recorded by CCTV cameras in public places, it is crucial to recognize faces in surveillance footage. To achieve this, we propose using a cascade classifier to extract frames from the video containing face images. These frames are then fed into an SRGAN to generate high-resolution images. Additionally, in cases where the surveillance camera captures a face in a side view, we propose using a conditional GAN to generate a frontal face view.

Procedure to run website

1. Clone the repository
2. Download the Pix2Pix GAN trained model from Google drive link and put it under Final-Project-Folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NvfVkzQEsORsEJhvDr3w_7qNI007jeM0?usp=share_link
To create a virtual environment in Miniconda using a `requirements.txt` file, you can follow these steps:
3. create virtual environment
    1. First, make sure you have Miniconda installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Miniconda website              (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) based on your operating system.

    2. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to create a new virtual environment:

   ```shell
   conda create -n myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

    3. Activate the newly created virtual environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system:

    - **On Windows:**

     ```shell
     conda activate myenv
     ```


    4. Once the environment is activated, navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located using the `cd` command. For example:

    ```shell
    cd /path/to/requirements.txt
    ```

    5. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt` using the `pip` command:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file into your virtual environment.

    6. After the installation completes, you can start using your virtual environment with the installed packages.

    Remember to replace `/path/to/requirements.txt` with the actual path to your `requirements.txt` file.

    That's it! You have created a virtual environment in Miniconda and installed the packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. Navigate the folder which have web.py and run 
     ```shell
      python web.py
     ```

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

The development of deep learning models for image processing has
been a topic of interest in recent years. In this study, we present a novel approach
for improving the quality of facial images through the use of two distinct deep
convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) and super resolution
generative adversarial network (SRGAN). Specifically, the DCGAN model is
used for face image completion, and the SRGAN model is utilized for resolution
enhancement. Our proposed DCGAN model has been designed to retain the
identity information of the original face, while also enhancing the performance
of facial image completion. On the other hand, the SRGAN model is capable
of improving image quality by a scaling factor of 4, which is a significant
improvement compared to existing methods.

To further enhance the capabilities of our proposed approach,
we have also developed a Pix2Pix Gan for frontal face view generation.
Through extensive experimental results, we have demonstrated that our method
outperforms existing methods in terms of face image processing. However,
it is important to note that the training of a super resolution GAN requires a
substantial amount of computational resources, particularly in terms of GPUâ€™s
and real-time data. For the purposes of this study, we trained our SRGAN model
with a dataset of 5000 images, and the model worked well on face images
exclusively. Moving forward, future work will focus on training a SRGAN
model with a larger dataset and more epochs to develop an even more refined
model. Ultimately, our approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of
facial image processing, with applications in various industries, such as security,
entertainment, and healthcare.
